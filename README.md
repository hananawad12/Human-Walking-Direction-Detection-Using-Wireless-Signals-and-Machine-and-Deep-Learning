# Human-Walking-Direction-Detection-Using-Wireless-Signals-and-Machine-and-Deep-Learning
we introduced a device-free method that can precisely identify the direction of human walk using CSI of Wi-Fi signals, machine, and deep learning algorithms. Raw CSI signals are first calibrated and effectively denoised using Hampel filter and DWT algorithms.
We conducted extensive experiments in two indoor environments. Our system, using SVM and CSI amplitudes, achieved recognition accuracy of 92.9\%, 95.1\%, and 89\% in the classroom, meeting room, and both rooms, respectively. Additionally, our system, employing 1D-CNN and CSI amplitudes, demonstrated recognition accuracy rates of 88.1\%, 100\%, and 84.2\% in the classroom, meeting room, and both rooms, respectively.  

Our experiments consistently proved the robustness of our system in various scenarios. The accuracy remained stable even with an increasing number of volunteers and different training sizes, different individuals, environments, group sizes, and training data variations. Our approach demonstrates versatility in its applicability across various scenarios. It can be effectively employed to track the walking direction of customers in retail stores. Furthermore, in security systems, it proves valuable for monitoring human walking directions and detecting unauthorized access in restricted areas.
